# üß™ MATLAB Physical Chemistry & Biophysics Simulations

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB Live Scripts (`.mlx`) created during a physical chemistry and biophysics course. The scripts simulate and analyze a range of topics across **statistical mechanics**, **molecular kinetics**, **fluorescence dynamics**, and **random walks**, combining theory with data visualization and modeling.

---

## üìÇ Contents

The repository includes simulation notebooks on topics such as:

- **Excited state kinetics**
- **Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distributions**
- **Random walks and diffusion**
- **RET (Resonance Energy Transfer) efficiency modeling**
- **Fluorescence decay (mono-, bi-exponential, and quenching)**
- **Phasor plots for lifetime analysis**
- **Voltage-dependent channel gating**
- **Binomial and Gaussian distributions**

Each script explores a specific physical model or biological process through:

- Simulation of stochastic behavior  
- Analytical or numerical solutions  
- Data fitting (least-squares, curve fitting, etc.)  
- Visualizations (time evolution, histograms, KDEs, etc.)

## üìå Notes

- Scripts are modular and can be customized easily for different parameters.
- Code is thoroughly commented to support learning and experimentation.
- Designed to support both **visual learners** and those interested in the **math behind the models**.
